These will be **friction**, $f(x,t)$, and **slip**, $\\delta(x,t)$.\n\nRecall, we introduced a **linear slip-weakening** friction formulation\n\n\\begin{equation}\nf=\\begin{cases} \n      f_s - (f_s-f_d)\\delta/\\delta_c & \\delta\\leq \\delta_c \\\\\n      f_d & \\delta > \\delta_c \n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\n\nTherefore, friction evolution is governing directly by slip evolution\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{df}{dt}=\\begin{cases} \n      - (f_s-f_d)V/\\delta_c & \\delta\\leq \\delta_c \\\\\n      0 & \\delta > \\delta_c \n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $V=d\\delta/dt$. Furthermore, we can rearrange the stress equation introduced at the beginning of this notebook in terms of $V=d\\delta/dt$ explicitly\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d\\delta}{dt}=\\frac{2c}{\\mu}\\left(\\tau_0-f\\sigma_n - \\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi}\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{d\\delta/dx'}{x-x'}dx'\\right).\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere we are **requiring** that fault stress, $\\tau$, at all times is **equal** to the (evolving) frictional strength, $f\\sigma_n$.\n\nThus, we have a pair of **coupled ODEs** that can be solved according to whichever timestepping method you prefer. \n\nFor example, an **improved Euler step**:\n\n1. Specify friction, $f_0$, and slip, $\\delta_0$, at time $t$.\n2. Compute velocity, $V_0$, at time $t$, using $f_0$ and $\\delta_0$.\n2. Compute predictor friction, $f_1^P$, at time, $t+dt$, using $V_0$.\n3. Compute predictor slip, $\\delta_1^P$, at time, $t+dt$, using $V_0$.\n4. Compute predictor velocity, $V_1^P$, at time $t+dt$, using $f_1^P$ and $\\delta_1^P$.\n5. Compute corrector velocity, $V_1^C=(V_0+V_1^P)/2$.\n6. Compute corrector friction, $f_1^C$, and slip, $\\delta_1^C$, at time $t+dt$, using $V_1^C$.\n\nThese equations have been implemented for you in the Python module `qk2.py`.\n\n***Execute the cell below to create and visualise an initial stress state for your fault (shear and normal stress, static and dynamic frictions).***"
